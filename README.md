# Simple UNO pump
> This project is a work in progress so please thoroughly test any code that you wish to use

The pump code in this project was born of necessity at the end of covid when
a part broke on my pump during the last week of my project. This code is written
for a beginner arduino coder (by a beginner arduino coder) to be able to hack
to pieces and get a syringe pump working as fast as possible with the most basic
parts possible. So please take this code and make it better.

There are many amazing open source syringe pump projects for research
applications. I recommend searching https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jceda8 for the
latest. The pumps in these journals have great manuals and are properly
calibrated (unlike this one). However, changing their code quickly was not
possible for me. I hope this really simple code is easy to adapt.


Please test everything with water, and then blank solvent before using your pump.
Calibrate it with your solvent of choice. Don't forget to keep your electronics
safe from your liquids, make sure you have adequate ventilation, you have filled
out your COSHH forms and always wear the correct PPE.

Have Fun!

## Getting started
The code lives as one sketch in the LEMpumpcode_v3.2_2022 folder as an ino file.
The code is written for an UNO Rev3.
Please make sure you have the arduino ide or soemthing that can compile
ino files set-up.

## To be created
- Circuit diagrams
- pump body 3D files
- links to parts
- manual
- unit tests

## Useful links

links to help with this code and it has been an incredible resource for learning.
